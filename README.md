## Project Description

This is a simple react app built with typescript template.
It contains a TodoList component which expects to take an item prop, and a list of objects, each with text and done properties. The TodoList also accepts an onItemClick function prop, which is called when a user clicks an item in the list (provided the item is not marked as Done) else the onClickItem function is not called and the click event is not propagated further. 
The function is called with the item object from the items list as the first parameter and the event as the second parameter.
